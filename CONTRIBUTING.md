## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/SocialEngine/phpv4-issues/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
  the [SocialEngine Community](https://community.onsocialengine.com/hot),
  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/socialengine)
  or other channels).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code that you downloaded
from SocialEngine.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest version of software.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).
